Action-Potential-Refractory-Period-Model
========================================
This is an action potential model written in MATLAB as a project for one of my classes, BME 4641, Bioelectricity.  Included in the code is a refractory period model based upon parameters and differential equations outlined in the Hodgkin and Huxley model of the neuron (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/), modeling the elicited amplitude response of the AP at certain restimulus times.
